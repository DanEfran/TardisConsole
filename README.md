# TardisConsole
A custom lights-and-sounds busy-box controller for a TARDIS control console.

Surely a perpetual work in progress, this is the firmware for my homemade TARDIS console's Arduino-powered control board. It responds to control inputs such as the Dematerialization Switch with appropriate lights and sounds, panel meter settings, etc.

Note that some of the controls and lights are hard-wired and bypass this system.
